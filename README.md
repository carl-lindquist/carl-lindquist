Howdy,

I'm @carl-lindquist. I work on airplane software for [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com).

I'm not looking for new work. 

My profile is a bit dusty at the moment because work keeps me busy.

I want to work on embedded applications, especially projects which are ecologically or environmentally focused. Bonus points if it's a Rust application ðŸ¦€!
